# Event Planning Feature Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a comprehensive event planning page that follows the OLX-style structure described in the requirements. The page provides two main user flows: one for customers who need event managers, and another for event managers who want to offer their services.

## Problem Description
Previously, the event planning functionality was limited to:
- **Basic Event Booking**: Simple event booking modal with restaurant integration
- **Limited Scope**: Only restaurant-based event management
- **No Marketplace**: No platform for independent event managers
- **No Customer Requirements**: No way for customers to post event requirements
- **No Manager Profiles**: No system for event managers to showcase services

## Solution Implementation

### 1. **New Event Planning Page**

**File**: `src/pages/EventPlanning.tsx`

**Key Features**:
