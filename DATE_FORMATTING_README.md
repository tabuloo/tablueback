# Date Formatting Updates for Restaurant Owner Dashboard

## Overview
This update enhances the Restaurant Owner Dashboard with improved date formatting and display features for orders and bookings.

## New Features

### 1. Smart Date Formatting
- **Today**: Shows "Today" for orders/bookings placed on the current date
- **Yesterday**: Shows "Yesterday" for orders/bookings placed yesterday
- **Other dates**: Shows formatted date (e.g., "Dec 15, 2024")

### 2. Enhanced Order Display
- Date badges with clock icons showing when orders were placed
- Time information displayed alongside dates
- Visual indicators for order timing

### 3. Enhanced Booking Display
- Date badges with clock icons showing when bookings were made
- Time information for booking creation
- Clear visual separation of booking dates

### 4. Today's Summary Sections
- **Orders Tab**: Shows today's order count, pending orders, completed orders, and revenue
- **Bookings Tab**: Shows today's booking count, pending bookings, confirmed bookings, and revenue

### 5. Improved UI Elements
- Sort options for orders and bookings
- "Today Only" filter buttons (ready for implementation)
- Last updated timestamp
- Responsive design improvements

## Technical Implementation

### New Utility Functions (`src/utils/dateUtils.ts`)
```typescript
export const formatOrderDate = (date: Date): string
export const formatBookingDate = (date: Date): string
export const formatTime = (date: Date): string
```

### Date Logic
- Compares order/booking dates with current date
- Returns appropriate text based on timing
- Handles edge cases (today, yesterday, other dates)

### Visual Enhancements
- Color-coded date badges (blue for orders, purple for bookings)
- Clock icons for better visual recognition
- Responsive grid layouts for summary sections

## Usage Examples

### Order Date Display
- **Same day**: "Today at 2:30 PM"
- **Yesterday**: "Yesterday at 11:45 AM"
- **Other days**: "Dec 14, 2024 at 9:15 AM"

### Booking Date Display
- **Same day**: "Today at 3:20 PM"
- **Yesterday**: "Yesterday at 1:30 PM"
- **Other days**: "Dec 13, 2024 at 4:45 PM"

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Restaurant owners can quickly identify recent orders/bookings
2. **Improved Workflow**: Clear date information helps with prioritization
3. **Visual Clarity**: Date badges make it easy to scan through items
4. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard shows current data with last updated timestamp
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all device sizes

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation includes placeholder functions for:
- Today's filter toggle functionality

- Date range filtering
- Export functionality for date-specific data

These can be implemented based on user feedback and requirements.
