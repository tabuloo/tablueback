### Revenue Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Today's Revenue Calculation
const today = new Date();
const todayOrders = restaurantOrders.filter(order => 
  order.createdAt && 
  new Date(order.createdAt).toDateString() === today.toDateString()
);
const todayBookings = restaurantBookings.filter(booking => 
  booking.createdAt && 
  new Date(booking.createdAt).toDateString() === today.toDateString()
);

const ordersRevenue = todayOrders.reduce((sum, order) => sum + order.total, 0);
const bookingsRevenue = todayBookings.reduce((sum, booking) => sum + booking.amount, 0);
const totalRevenue = ordersRevenue + bookingsRevenue;
```
