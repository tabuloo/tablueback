# Navigation Overlap Fix

## Overview
Fixed the overlapping issue between the "TABULOO" logo and "Book Table" navigation items in the header navigation bar.

## Issues Identified
- Logo and navigation items were too close together causing overlap
- Insufficient spacing between navigation elements
- Navigation items were too large for the available space
- Responsive breakpoints needed adjustment

## Changes Made

### 1. Logo Section Improvements
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent logo from shrinking
- Reduced logo image size from `h-12 sm:h-16` to `h-10 sm:h-12`
- Reduced logo text size from `text-xl sm:text-2xl` to `text-lg sm:text-xl`
- This provides more space for navigation items

### 2. Navigation Spacing Fixes
- Increased main navigation container spacing from `space-x-4` to `space-x-6`
- Reduced quick actions spacing from `space-x-6` to `space-x-3`
- Added `gap-4` to the main header flex container for better separation

### 3. Navigation Item Sizing
- Reduced button padding from `px-4` to `px-2`
- Reduced icon size from `h-5 w-5` to `h-4 w-4`
- Added responsive text sizing: `text-xs lg:text-sm`
- Added responsive text visibility: `hidden lg:inline` for action titles

### 4. Responsive Breakpoint Adjustments
- Changed navigation visibility from `hidden md:flex` to `hidden md:flex`
- Text labels now show on large screens (`lg:inline`) instead of extra large (`xl:inline`)
- Better tablet and desktop experience

## File Modified
- `src/components/Header.tsx`

## Result
- No more overlap between logo and navigation items
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Improved responsive design for different screen sizes
- Cleaner, more professional navigation appearance
- Better use of available header space

## Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: Navigation hidden, hamburger menu shown
- **Tablet (md)**: Navigation visible with icons only
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Navigation visible with icons and text labels
- **All sizes**: Proper spacing prevents overlap issues
